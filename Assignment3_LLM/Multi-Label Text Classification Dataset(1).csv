Expression of p53 and coexistence of HPV in premalignant lesions and in cervical cancer.,"Fifty-four paraffin embedded tissue sections from patients with dysplasia (21 cases) and with cervical cancer (33 cases) were analysed. HPV was detected and identified in two stages. Firstly, using mixed starters, chosen genomic DNA sequences were amplified; secondly the material thus obtained was analyzed by hybridization method using oligonucleotyde 31-P labelled probe. HPVs of type 6, 11, 16, 18, 33 were identified. The p-53 expression was assayed by immunohistochemical method. HPV infection was often associated with dysplasia and cervical cancer. In cervical cancer mainly HPV 16 and 18 with high oncogenic potential were found. The p-53 was present rarely, and in minute quantities. No correlation was observed between presence of p-53 and HPVs DNA.","['DNA Probes, HPV', 'DNA, Viral', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Papillomaviridae', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53', 'Uterine Cervical Dysplasia', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms']",8549602,"[['D13.444.600.223.555', 'D27.505.259.750.600.223.620', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.620'], ['D13.444.308.568'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['B04.280.210.655', 'B04.613.204.655'], ['D12.776.157.687.650', 'D12.776.260.820', 'D12.776.624.776.775', 'D12.776.660.720.650', 'D12.776.744.845'], ['C04.834.818', 'C13.351.500.852.593.074'], ['C04.588.945.418.948.850', 'C13.351.500.852.593.131', 'C13.351.500.852.762.850', 'C13.351.937.418.875.850']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Vitamin D status in pregnant Indian women across trimesters and different seasons and its correlation with neonatal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels.,"The present cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the vitamin D status of pregnant Indian women and their breast-fed infants. Subjects were recruited from the Department of Obstetrics, Armed Forces Clinic and Army Hospital (Research and Referral), Delhi. A total of 541 apparently healthy women with uncomplicated, single, intra-uterine gestation reporting in any trimester were consecutively recruited. Of these 541 women, 299 (first trimester, ninety-seven; second trimester, 125; third trimester, seventy-seven) were recruited in summer (April-October) and 242 (first trimester, fifty-nine, second trimester, ninety-three; third trimester, ninety) were recruited in winter (November-March) to study seasonal variations in vitamin D status. Clinical, dietary, biochemical and hormonal evaluations for the Ca-vitamin D-parathormone axis were performed. A subset of 342 mother-infant pairs was re-evaluated 6 weeks postpartum. Mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) of pregnant women was 23.2 (SD 12.2) nmol/l. Hypovitaminosis D (25(OH)D < 50 nmol/l) was observed in 96.3 % of the subjects. Serum 25(OH)D levels were significantly lower in winter in the second and third trimesters, while serum intact parathormone (iPTH) and alkaline phosphatase levels were significantly higher in winter in all three trimesters. A significant negative correlation was found between serum 25(OH)D and iPTH in mothers (r - 0.367, P = 0.0001) and infants (r - 0.56, P = 0.0001). A strong positive correlation was observed between 25(OH)D levels of mother-infant pairs (r 0.779, P = 0.0001). A high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D was observed in pregnancy, lactation and infancy with no significant inter-trimester differences in serum 25(OH)D levels.","['Adult', 'Alkaline Phosphatase', 'Breast Feeding', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'India', 'Infant', 'Infant Nutrition Disorders', 'Lactation', 'Mothers', 'Nutritional Status', 'Parathyroid Hormone', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnancy Trimesters', 'Seasons', 'Vitamin D', 'Vitamin D Deficiency', 'Vitamins', 'Young Adult']",21736816,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D08.811.277.352.650.035'], ['F01.145.407.199', 'G07.203.650.195', 'G07.203.650.220.500.500', 'G07.203.650.353.199'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.252.245.393'], ['M01.060.703'], ['C18.654.422'], ['G08.686.523', 'G08.686.702.500'], ['F01.829.263.500.320.200', 'I01.880.853.150.500.340.270', 'M01.620.630'], ['G07.203.650.650', 'N01.224.425.525'], ['D06.472.699.590', 'D12.644.548.587'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['C13.703'], ['G08.686.707'], ['G01.910.645.661', 'G16.500.275.071.590', 'N06.230.300.100.250.525'], ['D04.210.500.812.768'], ['C18.654.521.500.133.770'], ['D27.505.696.494.600', 'G07.203.300.681.500.600', 'J02.500.681.500.600'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1
[Identification of a functionally important dipeptide in sequences of atypical opioid peptides].,"The occurrence of individual amino acids and dipeptide fragments in the sequences of 60 known atypical opioid peptides was analyzed. An expressed predominance of Tyr-Pro fragment suggested a high probability of analgesic activity for this dipeptide, and it was experimentally studied. It was shown on somatic and visceral pain sensitivity models that, on the i.p. administration of Tyr-Pro at doses of 1.0-10 mg/kg of body mass, it exhibits an analgesic activity eliminated by naloxone and naloxone methiodide. However, in tests on ileum preparations of guinea pig and mouse vas deferens in vitro, Tyr-Pro was devoid of opioid activity, which proved its indirect influence on opioid receptors.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Analgesics, Opioid', 'Animals', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Dipeptides', 'Guinea Pigs', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Muscle, Smooth', 'Narcotic Antagonists', 'Opioid Peptides', 'Pain Measurement', 'Rats', 'Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1', 'Receptors, Opioid']",19060934,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['D27.505.696.277.600.500', 'D27.505.696.663.850.014.760.500', 'D27.505.954.427.040.550.500', 'D27.505.954.427.210.600.500'], ['B01.050'], ['G02.111.570.580.175'], ['D12.644.456.345'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.550'], ['E05.481'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G11.427.494'], ['A02.633.570', 'A10.690.467'], ['D27.505.696.543', 'D27.505.696.663.850.512', 'D27.505.954.427.550'], ['D12.644.400.575', 'D12.776.631.650.575'], ['E01.370.600.550.324'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['D12.776.543.750.695.125.100'], ['D12.776.543.750.695.620', 'D12.776.543.750.720.600.610', 'D12.776.543.750.750.555.610']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
Multilayer capsules: a promising microencapsulation system for transplantation of pancreatic islets.,"In 1980, Lim and Sun introduced a microcapsule coated with an alginate/polylysine complex for encapsulation of pancreatic islets. Characteristic to this type of capsule is, that it consists of a plain membrane which is formed during a single procedural step. With such a simple process it is difficult to obtain instantly a membrane optimized with respect to all the properties requested for islet transplantation. To overcome these difficulties, it is recommended to build up the membrane in several consecutive steps, each optimized for a certain property. In this study, we have analysed such a multilayer microcapsule for the encapsulation of pancreatic islets. Therefore, empty and islet containing alginate beads were coated with alternating layers of polyethyleneimine, polyacrylacid or carboxymethylcellulose and alginate. By scanning electron microscopy the thickness of the covering multilayer-membrane was estimated to be less than 800 nm by comparison with an apparatus scale. Ellipsometric measurements showed that the membrane thickness is in the range of 145 nm. Neither the encapsulation procedure, nor the membrane-forming step did impede the stimulatory response of the islets. The encapsulation even lead to a significantly better stimulatory response of the encapsulated islets during week three and five of cell culture. Furthermore, the multilayer-membrane did not deteriorate the biocompatibility of the transplanted microcapsules, allowing an easy tuning of the molecular cut-off and the mechanical stability depending on the polycation-polyanion combination used. The multilayer membrane capsule has obvious advantages compared to a one-step encapsulation procedure. These beads guarantee a high biocompatibility, a precisely adjusted cut-off, an optimal insulin-response and high mechanical stability although the membrane is only 145 nm thick.","['Acrylic Resins', 'Alginates', 'Animals', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biopolymers', 'Carboxymethylcellulose Sodium', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Compressive Strength', 'Drug Compounding', 'Female', 'Fibrosis', 'Glucuronic Acid', 'Hexuronic Acids', 'Islets of Langerhans Transplantation', 'Materials Testing', 'Microspheres', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Particle Size', 'Permeability', 'Polyethyleneimine', 'Polyethylenes', 'Polylysine', 'Prostheses and Implants', 'Quaternary Ammonium Compounds', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Lew', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Transplantation, Heterotopic']",11426874,"[['D05.750.716.822.111', 'D25.720.716.822.111', 'J01.637.051.720.716.822.111'], ['D09.698.068'], ['B01.050'], ['D25.130', 'D27.720.102.130', 'J01.637.051.130'], ['D05.750.078', 'D25.720.099', 'J01.637.051.720.099'], ['D09.698.365.180.663.329'], ['A11.251'], ['G01.374.180'], ['E05.916.270'], ['C23.550.355'], ['D02.241.081.844.915.162.249', 'D02.241.152.811.162.500', 'D02.241.511.902.915.162.500', 'D09.811.922.162.500'], ['D02.241.081.844.915.400', 'D02.241.152.811.400', 'D02.241.511.902.915.400', 'D09.811.922.400'], ['E02.095.147.500.250', 'E04.270.550', 'E04.936.225.375'], ['E05.570'], ['E07.565'], ['A02.633.567', 'A10.690.552.500'], ['G02.712'], ['G02.723'], ['D02.455.326.271.665.550.600', 'D02.491.650', 'D05.750.716.507.600', 'D25.720.716.507.600', 'J01.637.051.720.716.507.600'], ['D02.455.326.271.665.550', 'D05.750.716.507', 'D25.720.716.507', 'J01.637.051.720.716.507'], ['D12.125.068.555.750', 'D12.125.095.647.750', 'D12.644.760'], ['E07.695'], ['D01.625.062.500', 'D02.092.877', 'D02.675.276'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760.280', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400.280'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['E04.936.800']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Nanohydrogel with N,N'-bis(acryloyl)cystine crosslinker for high drug loading.","Substantially improved hydrogel particles based on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPA) have been obtained. First, as a result of replacing commercially available N,N'-bis(acryloyl)cystamine (BAC), the crosslinker, with acryloyl derivative of cystine containing a carboxylic group (BISS), the hydrogel particles acquired improved stability vs. ionic strength and allowed further chemical modification of the chains, including the attachment of drug molecules. Next, a redox-initiated aqueous precipitation polymerization via the semi-batch method was used. This led to substantially increased BISS content and diminished size of the nanoparticles that made them suitable to an endocytic process. In addition, the obtained nanogels revealed high loading capacity of anticancer drug vs. dry gel (circa 16%) and they exhibited much better stability and enhanced drug release under the typical conditions existing in cancer cells. Size of obtained nanogels was investigated by dynamic light scattering (DLS). It appeared that nanoparticle size was in the range from ca. 40 to 200nm. In 0.01M solution of glutathione (GSH) the -S-S- bonds were reduced and the nanogel particles were degraded. This could be seen in obtained SEM and TEM micrographs. The cytotoxicity investigation against the HeLa cells showed that DOX loaded nanogels were more cytotoxic (IC50=0.51ìM) than free DOX (IC50=0.83ìM), while unloaded nanogels did not inhibit proliferation of the cells. It was also found that the nanogels loaded with DOX reached a high intracellular concentration in HeLa cells just after 2h while free DOX needed 6h for that.","['Antineoplastic Agents', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Cystine', 'Doxorubicin', 'Drug Carriers', 'Drug Liberation', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogels', 'Nanoparticles']",28323099,"[['D27.505.954.248'], ['G04.161.750', 'G07.345.249.410.750'], ['G04.346'], ['D27.720.470.410.210'], ['D01.248.497.158.874.390.369', 'D01.875.350.850.150.369', 'D02.886.030.230.369', 'D02.886.520.150.087', 'D12.125.095.369', 'D12.125.119.369', 'D12.125.166.230.369'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.562.050.200.175', 'D04.615.562.050.200.175', 'D09.408.051.059.200.175'], ['D26.255.260', 'E02.319.300.380'], ['G02.211', 'G03.787.321', 'G07.690.725.321'], ['A11.251.210.190.400', 'A11.251.860.180.400', 'A11.436.340'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D20.280.320.375', 'D26.255.165.320.375'], ['J01.637.512.600']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"A new <i>Panolis</i> H?bner, [1821] species from Vietnam (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae, Orthosiini).","Panolis is a well-defined and compact Palearctic trifine Noctuidae genus within the subfamily Hadeninae, tribus Orthosiini. It is currently represented by seven species and one subspecies: Panolis flammea ([Denis & Schifferm?ller], 1775), Panolis japonica Draudt, 1935, Panolis variegatoides Poole, 1989, Panolis exquisita Draudt, 1950, Panolis pinicortex Draudt, 1950, Panolis pinicortex exornata Hreblay & Ronkay, 1997, Panolis estheri Ronkay, Ronkay, Gyulai & Hacker, 2010 and Panolis ningshan Wang, Fan, Owada, Wang & Nylin, 2014. Only one species (P. flammea) occurs in the Western Palearctic region, while all others are found in the eastern part of Asia. No Panolis species is known outside of the Palearctic region. The genus is connected to coniferous woodlands as the larvae are feed on various species of pines. Imagoes are on the wing during the spring, from late February until May. All Panolis species have an unmistakable, rather decorative external appearance with fine and conspicuous pink-red-purple or dark orange ground colouration, and remarkable noctuid patterns. Most recent information about the genus was provided by Wang et. al, 2014, including his description of a new species, and a morphological and molecular analysis in order to reconstructing the phylogeny of the genus, and exploring its Chines Oriental origin. Present paper contains the description of a new Panolis species found recently in Vietnam, from where the genus was not known so far.

Tramadol vs dexmedetomidine for emergence agitation control in pediatric patients undergoing adenotonsillectomy with sevoflurane anesthesia: prospective randomized controlled clinical study.,"BACKGROUND: This study was designed to compare the efficacy of an intraoperative single dose administration of tramadol and dexmedetomidine on hemodynamics and postoperative recovery profile including pain, sedation, emerge reactions in pediatric patients undergoing adenotonsillectomy with sevoflurane anesthesia.METHODS: Seventy-seven patient, aged 2-12, undergoing adenotonsillectomy with sevoflurane anesthesia was enrolled in this study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous 2 mg/kg tramadol (Group T; n = 39) or 1 ìg/kg dexmedetomidine (Group D; n = 38) after intubation. Heart rates (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP) were recorded before induction, at induction and every 5 min after induction. Observational pain scores (OPS), pediatric anesthesia emergence delirium (PAED) scores, percentage of patients with OPS ? 4 or PAED scale items 4 or 5 with an intensity of 3 or 4, and Ramsay sedation scores (RSS) were recorded on arrival to the postoperative care unit (PACU) and at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60 min. Extubation time and time to reach Alderete score > 9 were recorded.RESULTS: Dexmedetomidine significantly decreased the HR and MAP 10 and 15 min after induction; increased the RSS 15, 30 and 45 min after arrival to PACU.

Nucleotide diphosphates activate the ATP-sensitive potassium channel in mouse skeletal muscle.,"Patch-clamp techniques were used to study the effects of internal nucleotide diphosphates on the KATP channel in mouse skeletal muscle. In inside-out patches, application of GDP (100 microM) and ADP (100 microM) reversibly increased the channel activity. In the presence of internal Mg2+ (1 mM), low concentrations of ADP (< 300 microM) enhanced channel activity and high concentrations of ADP (> 300 microM) limited channel opening while GDP activated the channel at all concentrations tested. In the absence of internal Mg2+, ADP decreased channel activity at all concentrations tested while GDP had no noticeable effect at submillimolar concentrations and inhibited channel activity at millimolar concentrations. GDP [beta S] (100 microM), which behaved as a weak GDP agonist in the presence of Mg2+, stimulated ADP-evoked activation whereas it inhibited GDP-evoked activation. The K+ channel opener pinacidil was found to activate the KATP channel but only in the presence of internal GDP, ADP and GDP [beta S]. The results are discussed in terms of the existence of multiple nucleotide binding sites, in charge of the regulation of the KATP channel.","['Adenosine Diphosphate', 'Adenosine Triphosphate', 'Animals', 'Electrophysiology', 'Guanosine Diphosphate', 'Magnesium', 'Mice', 'Muscles', 'Potassium Channels', 'Thionucleotides']",1488275,"[['D03.633.100.759.646.138.124', 'D13.695.667.138.124', 'D13.695.827.068.124'], ['D03.633.100.759.646.138.236', 'D13.695.667.138.236', 'D13.695.827.068.236'], ['B01.050'], ['H01.158.344.528', 'H01.158.782.236'], ['D03.633.100.759.646.454.340', 'D13.695.667.454.340', 'D13.695.827.426.340'], ['D01.268.552.437', 'D01.268.557.500', 'D01.552.547.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['A02.633', 'A10.690'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.600', 'D12.776.543.550.450.750', 'D12.776.543.585.400.750'], ['D02.886.765', 'D13.695.900']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Using Standardized Checklists Increase the Completion Rate of Critical Actions in an Evacuation from the Operating Room: A Randomized Controlled Simulation Study.,"INTRODUCTION: Hospital evacuations of patients with special needs are extremely challenging, and it is difficult to train hospital workers for this rare event.Hypothesis/Problem:Researchers developed an in-situ simulation study investigating the effect of standardized checklists on the evacuation of a patient under general anesthesia from the operating room (OR) and hypothesized that checklists would improve the completion rate of critical actions and decrease evacuation time.METHODS: A vertical evacuation of the high-fidelity manikin (SimMan3G; Laerdal Inc.; Norway) was performed and participants were asked to lead the team and evacuate the manikin to the ground floor after a mock fire alarm. Participants were randomized to two groups: one was given an evacuation checklist (checklist group [CG]) and the other was not (non-checklist group [NCG]). A total of 19 scenarios were run with 28 participants.RESULTS: Mean scenario time, preparation phase of evacuation, and time to transport the manikin down the stairs did not differ significantly between groups (P = .369, .462, and .935, respectively). The CG group showed significantly better performance of critical actions, including securing the airway, taking additional drug supplies, and taking additional equipment supplies (P = .047, .001, and .001, respectively). In the post-evacuation surveys, 27 out of 28 participants agreed that checklists would improve the evacuation process in a real event.CONCLUSION: Standardized checklists increase the completion rate of pre-defined critical actions in evacuations out of the OR, which likely improves patient safety. Checklist use did not have a significant effect on total evacuation time.","['Checklist', 'Civil Defense', 'Emergencies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Natural Disasters', 'Operating Rooms', 'Patient Care Team', 'Patient Safety', 'Simulation Training', 'Time Factors', 'United States']",31389323,"[['N05.715.360.300.179'], ['I01.451.227'], ['C23.550.291.781', 'N06.230.100.083', 'N06.850.376'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['N06.230.100.230'], ['N02.278.388.700'], ['N04.590.715'], ['N06.850.135.060.075.399'], ['I02.903.847'], ['G01.910.857'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
"Tolerability of the low-affinity, use-dependent NMDA antagonist AR-R15896AR in stroke patients: a dose-ranging study.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: AR-R15896AR is a use-dependent, low-affinity blocker of the NMDA ion channel with neuroprotective effects in animal models of focal cerebral ischemia. This study aimed to establish the highest safe and tolerated loading and maintenance dosing regimen of AR-R15896AR in acute ischemic stroke patients and to determine the associated plasma concentrations of AR-R15896AR.METHODS: This was a 4-part, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 175 patients (mean age, 69 years) within 24 hours of acute stroke symptom recognition. Ascending 60-minute intravenous infusion loading doses of AR-R15896AR were initially examined (100, 150, 200, 250, or 300 mg or placebo in 3:1 randomization, n=36 treated); in part 2, 250, 275, or 300 mg was compared with placebo (n=33). In part 3, a 250-mg loading dose was followed by 9 maintenance doses of 60, 75, 90, 105, or 120 mg every 8 hours versus placebo in 3:1 randomization (n=59); subsequently, in part 4, maintenance doses of 90, 105, and 120 mg after the 250-mg loading dose were directly randomized against placebo (n=42). Safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics were the primary end points; NIHSS at 1 week and Barthel and modified Rankin scores at 1 month were also recorded, but the study was neither designed nor powered to assess efficacy.RESULTS: Rates for mortality and serious adverse events (SAE) were similar in active and placebo groups (9% mortality and 23% SAE for all active combined versus 11% mortality and 33% SAE for placebo). Adverse events associated with AR-R15896AR were dizziness, vomiting, nausea, stupor, and some agitation/hallucination. Withdrawal from treatment occurred only in response to loading doses with AR-R15896AR: placebo, 3 of 46 (7%); 250 mg, 11 of 89 (12%); 275 mg, 1 of 8 (12.5%); and 300 mg, 3 of 15 (20%). No significant difference in outcome was observed between groups. Plasma concentrations of AR-R15896AR were 1524+/-536 ng/mL at the end of the 250-mg loading infusion and were 1847+/-478 ng/mL at steady state after the 9 maintenance doses of 120 mg.CONCLUSIONS: The maximum tolerated loading infusion of AR-R15896AR in this study was 250 mg over a period of 1 hour. Subsequent maintenance infusions of 120 mg every 8 hours were well tolerated. With these doses, putative neuroprotective concentrations of 1240 ng/mL are attained by the loading dose and are satisfactorily maintained thereafter. The loading dose may be improved further by adjustment on an individual patient basis, but tolerability issues remain.","['Aged', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Pyridines', 'Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Stroke', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",11157184,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['E05.318.370.300', 'E05.581.500.300', 'N05.715.360.325.320', 'N06.850.520.445.300'], ['E05.290.625', 'E05.337.425'], ['D27.505.519.625.190.300', 'D27.505.696.577.190.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.319.267.082.500', 'E02.319.267.510.590'], ['D03.383.725'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.400.500.500', 'D12.776.543.550.450.500.200.500', 'D12.776.543.585.400.500.200.500', 'D12.776.543.750.720.200.450.400.500'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500'], ['C10.228.140.300.775', 'C14.907.253.855'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.900', 'N01.224.935.698.826', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.900', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.900'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Spatial distribution of external and internal intercostal activity in dogs.,"1. The observation that the external and internal interosseous intercostal muscles in the dog show marked regional differences in mechanical advantage has prompted us to re-examine the topographic distribution of electrical activity among these muscles during spontaneous breathing. 2. Inspiratory activity was recorded only from the areas of the external intercostals with an inspiratory mechanical advantage, and expiratory activity was recorded only from the areas of the internal intercostals with an expiratory mechanical advantage. The expiratory discharges previously recorded from the caudal external intercostals and the inspiratory discharges recorded from the rostral internal intercostals were probably due to cross-contamination. 3. Activity in each muscle area was also quantified relative to the activity measured during tetanic, supramaximal nerve stimulation (maximal activity). External intercostal inspiratory activity was consistently greater in the areas with a greater inspiratory advantage (i.e. the dorsal aspect of the rostral segments) than in the areas with a smaller inspiratory advantage, and internal intercostal expiratory activity was invariably greatest in the areas with the greatest expiratory advantage (i.e. the dorsal aspect of the caudal segments). 4. This topographic distribution of neural drive confers to the external intercostal muscles an inspiratory action on the lung during breathing and to the internal interosseous intercostals an expiratory action.","['Animals', 'Apnea', 'Dogs', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electromyography', 'Electrophysiology', 'Hypercapnia', 'Intercostal Muscles', 'Pressure', 'Respiration, Artificial', 'Respiratory Mechanics']",10373710,"[['B01.050'], ['C08.618.085', 'C23.888.852.130'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['E05.723.402'], ['E01.370.405.255', 'E01.370.530.255'], ['H01.158.344.528', 'H01.158.782.236'], ['C23.888.852.544'], ['A02.633.567.900.500'], ['G01.374.715'], ['E02.041.625', 'E02.365.647.729', 'E02.880.820'], ['G09.772.705.700']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Dysbiosis of the Gut Microbiome is associated with Tumor Biomarkers in Lung Cancer.,"Lung cancer is a malignancy with high morbidity and mortality worldwide. More evidences indicated that gut microbiome plays an important role in the carcinogenesis and progression of cancers by metabolism, inflammation and immune response. However, the study about the characterizations of gut microbiome in lung cancer is limited. In this study, the fecal samples were collected from 16 healthy individuals and 30 lung cancer patients who were divided into 3 groups based on different tumor biomarkers (cytokeratin 19 fragment, neuron specific enolase and carcinoembryonic antigen, respectively) and were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Each lung cancer group has characterized gut microbial community and presents an elimination, low-density, and loss of bacterial diversity microbial ecosystem compared to that of the healthy control. The microbiome structures in family and genera levels are more complex and significantly varied from each group presenting more different and special pathogen microbiome such as Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus, Prevotella, etc and fewer probiotic genera including Blautia, Coprococcus, Bifidobacterium and Lachnospiraceae. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and COG annotation demonstrated decreased abundance of some dominant metabolism-related pathways in the lung cancer. This study explores for the first time the features of gut microbiome in lung cancer patients and may provide new insight into the pathogenesis of lung cancer system, with the implication that gut microbiota may serve as a microbial marker and contribute to the derived metabolites, development and differentiation in lung cancer system.","['Aged', 'Bacteria', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Dysbiosis', 'Feces', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S']",31595156,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['B03'], ['D23.101.140'], ['C23.550.308'], ['A12.459'], ['G06.591.375', 'G16.500.275.157.049.100.500.375', 'N06.230.124.049.100.500.250'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.588.894.797.520', 'C08.381.540', 'C08.785.520'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D13.444.735.686.670']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
